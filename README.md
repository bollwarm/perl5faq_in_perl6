# The Perl 5 FAQ, answered in Perl 6

This is not the [Perl 6 FAQ](https://docs.perl6.org/language/faq).
These are the questions from the [Perl 5
FAQ](http://perldoc.perl.org/perlfaq.html) but answered in Perl 6.
This is not intended as a replacement for the official Perl 6 FAQ,
although that document is free to steal what it likes under the
Artistic License 2.0.

## The answers

There are several opportunities in providing new answers to old
questions. We can show off Perl 6.

Some things may be easier, and some things may not be problems
anymore. Noting those situations, even if the task is trivial, can
make Perl 6 look better.

Some tasks merely need the right example or module pointer, or the
name of the tool to use.

### Cookbook answers

Many of the questions in the Perl 5 version are more cookbook-based.
The questioner is interested in accomplishing a task and want to know
how to do it in Perl 5. The perlfaq usually showed a simple solution
in pure Perl 5 without the use of modules. Some recommended a module.
People will want to do the same sort of tasks in Perl 6.

### Gotcha answers

Some questions deal with common gotcha programming problems. These
were often interesting edge cases that aren't obvious from the
documentation or the behavior of other parts of the language. Perl 6
might have fixed many of these.

### Meta-programming answers

Not *meta-object* answers! These questions are about the programming
process and the tools to make that happen. People already have their
process and want to do the same thing with the Perl 6 tools.
