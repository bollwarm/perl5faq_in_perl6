Fork, edit, and send a pull request! For the moment, I'll act as the
editor to fix up the answers and handle a consistent tone and quality
throughout everything.

For the most part, leave the questions alone. You can translate "Perl"
to "Perl 6", but otherwise they should be almost the same thing as the
original question.

I don't intend to add new questions. For that, you should contribute
to the official Perl 6 FAQ (https://docs.perl6.org/language/faq.html).
I'm doing this more as a fun project than an attempt to create
language documentation.
